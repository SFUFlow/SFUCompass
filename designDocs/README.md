The design of SFU Nocte aims to be modern and minimalistic, yet being playful and fun. The aim is to hopefully not make it look like every other web app and take a step to become something unique and innovative.

## Logo & Name

The logo is themed around the Racoon, SFU's unofficial yet culturally apropriate mascot. It is paired with the name SFU Nocte, meaning night, because most students have a shit sleep schedule and are nocturnal... Variations of this logo can be found in SVG format in the Assets folder.
